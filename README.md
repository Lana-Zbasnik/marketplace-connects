# Marketplace Connects

## Overwiev 

This project aims to solve the problem of unfair treatment and scams among students, especially those studying in foreign countries. The solution is to create a reliable website, supported by universities, where students can buy and sell items they need for affordable prices without the risk of being scammed. The website includes a user login and profile page, a home page with search functionality, an item details page, a connect button for contacting sellers, an about page, and a contact page.

## Features

1. User login and profile page: Users can sign up using their student email accounts and enter their name and password to access their profile page.

2. Home page with search functionality: The website's home page displays the posted items with their photos, and users can search for specific items of interest.

3. Item details page: Users can click on the item photos to view them in a larger size, giving them access to other angles of the product that the person has posted.

4. Connect with other users: Once a user has found the desired item, they can click the "connect" button, which opens up a new window that directly sends an email to the person who posted it.

5. About Us page: Users can comprehend the website's mission and understand its purpose.

6. Contact Us page: Provides a platform for users to report any issues they encounter while navigating the website.

7. Sample images: Integrated some sample images from Google to give users an idea of how the website would look like if they were able to upload their photos.
