# Marketplace Connects

## Overwiev 

This project aims to solve the problem of unfair treatment and scams among students, especially those studying in foreign countries. The solution is to create a reliable website, supported by universities, where students can buy and sell items they need for affordable prices without the risk of being scammed. The website includes a user login and profile page, a home page with search functionality, an item details page, a connect button for contacting sellers, an about page, and a contact page.

## Features

1. User login and profile page: Users can sign up using their student email accounts and enter their name and password to access their profile page.

2. Home page with search functionality: The website's home page displays the posted items with their photos, and users can search for specific items of interest.

3. Item details page: Users can click on the item photos to view them in a larger size, giving them access to other angles of the product that the person has posted.

4. Connect with other users: Once a user has found the desired item, they can click the "connect" button, which opens up a new window that directly sends an email to the person who posted it.

5. About Us page: Users can comprehend the website's mission and understand its purpose.

6. Contact Us page: Provides a platform for users to report any issues they encounter while navigating the website.

7. Sample images: Integrated some sample images from Google to give users an idea of how the website would look like if they were able to upload their photos.

## Reflective summary

Upon completion of the project, I was able to achieve a highly promising result, a partially functional website with great potential. One of the key features of the front page of the web application is that allows users to input their name and password. Upon clicking the login button, they are redirected to their profile page. However, at present, there is no database in place to store users' information, which makes it impossible for them to have an actual profile. Nonetheless, I made it possible for users to navigate through the website as if they were able to create profiles, and I designed the website in a manner that would allow for easy integration of a database at a later stage. 

However, upon further reflection, I realized that it might have been more efficient to start by implementing the database first and building pages on top of that. By starting with the database, I could have streamlined the process of building the website's pages and functionality. 

Working on this project has also given me a deeper appreciation for the time and effort required to build a high-quality app. From researching best practices to meticulously testing and debugging, every step of the development process is essential to creating a successful product. I've learned that investing time upfront in research and planning can save significant time and resources down the line.

Beyond the technical aspects, I've also grown as a problem solver and critical thinker. This project presented numerous challenges that required me to think creatively and outside the box to find solutions. Through trial and error, I honed my problem-solving skills and learned to be more thoughtful and intentional in my approach.
